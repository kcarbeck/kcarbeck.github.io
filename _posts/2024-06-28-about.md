I am currently finishing my PhD at University of British Columbia, working in the [Arcese Lab](https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/peter-arcese/). Broadly, I am interested in harnessing new genomic, spatial, and machine learning approaches to investigate questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation. 

Before my PhD, I worked as a research assistant at the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence](https://www.bi.mpg.de/en), and in the [McWilliam's Lab](https://web.uri.edu/nrs/meet/scott-r-mcwilliams/) at the University of Rhode Island. Here, my research was focused on better understanding how birds contend with environmental change through physiological responses.

Outside of my professional interest in biological and environmental sciences, I spending most of my free time in the outdoors and being active. I love exploring the environment through running, mountain biking, camping, and skiing. Even better if I can bring my adventure partner, Sadie, with me!
